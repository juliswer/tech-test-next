This Application is a test for COBUILDLAB.
The app was created by [Julian Swerdlin](https://linkedin.com/in/julian-swerdlin) and done using Next.js and Material UI.
I used asyncronous to make a more efficient application for the user.
For the back I used the Next.js ServerSide Rendering API and MongoDB for the Database.
On the front I included the Material UI library, a small model with Three.js, animations to make a better UX, Auth0 for the login (storaged in the LocalStorage) and axios to make the requests to the API.
I hadn't time to make the Unit Testing, but I did make the CI/CD Pipeline.
The app is running on [Vercel](https://heroku.com/).
